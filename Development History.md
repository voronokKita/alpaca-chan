1st half of the day: <br>
I wrote all the tests for the navbar of all the apps. <br>
This is where I finished writing the tests, for now. But I will still read the django documentation on testing, maybe I will get some new ideas.

Some small tests optimization. Special reduced logger configuration for tests. <br>
