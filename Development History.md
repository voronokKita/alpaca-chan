### 2022.AUG.18

###### Auctions
To implement a redirect between ListingView, EditListingView and AuctionLotView and vice versa, in order of listing.is_active logic to work, I need to request the same listing instance from the db twice. So far I donâ€™t know how to get around this, so instead of a redirect I will display an empty page.

Wrote AuctionLotView basics, with buttons templates for future forms; logic with tags.
